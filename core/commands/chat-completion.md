# /chat-completion — End-of-session wrap-up

End-of-session protocol: save progress, generate handoff summary, report session metrics, and suggest next actions for the following session.

## Steps

1. **Gather session summary:**
   - Files created/modified this session (from git diff)
   - Tests run and their results
   - Tasks started/advanced/completed
   - Key decisions made
   - Unfinished work

2. **Write handoff if task is active:**
   - If an active task exists, run `/agent-handoff` to create a proper handoff file
   - Even if work is incomplete, write a partial handoff

3. **Generate session report:**
   ```
   ═══ Session Complete ═══
   Agent: builder
   Duration: ~45 minutes
   
   Completed:
   - Implemented IEEE 485 temperature correction module
   - Added 12 unit tests (all passing)
   
   In Progress:
   - Load profile integration (60% complete)
   
   Files Changed: 8 (4 source, 3 test, 1 config)
   Tests: 47 passed, 0 failed
   
   Next Session Priorities:
   1. Complete load profile integration (src/calculator/load-profile.ts)
   2. Run /ralph-loop to verify all quality gates
   3. Advance to Reviewer via /workflow-next
   
   Handoff: docs/agent-comms/TASK-001/02-builder-partial.json
   ═══════════════════════
   ```

4. **Offer to commit:**
   - If there are uncommitted changes, offer: "Commit progress? [y/N]"
   - If yes, run `/test-and-commit`

## When to Use

- End of a working session
- Before closing a tmux agent window
- When switching to a different task
- When the human says "let's wrap up" or "that's enough for today"
