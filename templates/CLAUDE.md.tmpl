# ${PROJECT_NAME} — Project Constitution

## Identity

**Project:** ${PROJECT_NAME}
**Description:** ${PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
**Stack:** ${LANGUAGE} / ${FRAMEWORK} / ${RUNTIME}

## Golden Rules

1. **Config-first:** Read all project-specific paths and commands from `.claude/project-config.yaml`. Never hardcode paths.
2. **Quality gates:** Every change must pass typecheck, lint, and tests before commit. Use `/test-and-commit`.
3. **Structured handoffs:** When passing work between agents, use `/agent-handoff` to write structured JSON to the handoff directory.
4. **Error handling:** Handle errors explicitly. No bare catch blocks. No swallowed errors.
5. **Test coverage:** New code requires tests. Target ${COVERAGE_THRESHOLD}% coverage on touched files.
