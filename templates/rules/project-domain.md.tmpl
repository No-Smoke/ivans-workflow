## Domain Concepts

<!-- Define key domain terms and their relationships -->
<!-- Example: "A Battery System consists of cells, modules, racks, and the room housing them." -->

## Business Rules

<!-- Rules specific to your domain that code must enforce -->
<!-- Example: "All temperature values must be in Celsius internally, converted to user preference on display." -->

## Naming Conventions

<!-- Project-specific naming beyond language conventions -->
<!-- Example: "Calculator modules use the pattern: {standard}-calculator.ts (e.g., ieee485-calculator.ts)" -->

## Integration Points

<!-- External systems, APIs, or services the project integrates with -->
<!-- Example: "ERPNext CRM for lead capture — API at /api/method/frappe.client.*" -->

## Security & Compliance

<!-- Regulatory or security requirements specific to this project -->
<!-- Example: "PDF reports must include IEEE 485 standard references for audit compliance." -->

## Common Pitfalls

<!-- Things that commonly go wrong in this project -->
<!-- Example: "CloudFlare D1 uses SQLite syntax — no RETURNING clause, use last_row_id instead." -->
